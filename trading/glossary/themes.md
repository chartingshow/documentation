## Themes

You can now choose between dark and light themes in the settings options. Switching between themes at any time to improve chart appearance during different lighting conditions.

We also plan to introduce even more themes such as `high contrast`, `tritanopia`, `protanopia & deuteranopia`, `dimmed mode` etc.
