## Themes

You can now choose between `dark` and `light` themes in the settings options. Switching between themes at any time to improve chart appearance during different lighting conditions.

We also plan to introduce even more themes such as `high contrast`, `tritanopia`, `protanopia & deuteranopia`, `dimmed mode` etc.
