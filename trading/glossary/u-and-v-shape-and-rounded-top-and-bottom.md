# U-Shape, V-Shape and Rounded Top and Bottom Patterns

## U-Shape Patterns

- The pattern always starts with a breakout in either direction.
- The initial breakout is always accompanied by a volatility/volume increase.
- The second phase of the pattern, when the initial breakout is over, is a consolidation or a range phase, when the bulls and bears fight to control the price. This is characterized by a constant, yet similar volume level throughout the range period which is lower than the breakout first phase period.
- The volume in the range goes back to an equilibrium state, because the initial breakout is so big and unsustainable that the price and volume must pullgo back to the original state.
- The third phase is a breakout of the range (second phase) and a full reversal. Again there are large volume candles and price big movement.
- All the positions in phase one get liquidated.
- Price action continues further than the breakout before phase one period.
- This whole pattern usually acts as a "fakeout" move.

### U-Shape Tops Patterns

Also known as Bearish U-Shape / Inverted U-Shape pattern.

## V-Shape Patterns

- The pattern always starts with a breakout in either direction.
- The initial breakout is always accompanied by a volatility/volume increase.
- The second phase is a very quick full reversal. Again there are large volume candles and price big movement.
- All the positions in phase one get liquidated.
- Price action continues further than the breakout before phase one period.
- This whole pattern usually acts as a "fakeout" move.

## Difference between U-Shape and V-Shape Patterns

The only difference between the two patterns is that U-Shape patterns contain three phases and V-Shape patterns contain two phases. U-Shape patterns have a consolidation (range) period in the middle; whereas V-Shape patterns do not have a consolidation (range) period and reveral very quickly!

U-Shape patterns are easier to trade as traders can set a breakout trade on the second phase on the consolidation (range) period.

V-Shape patterns are harder to trade, because V-tops and V-bottoms chart patterns are easy to spot after they have completed (but not while they are happening). Instead traders should trade the after effect when the V-Shape pattern has been confirmed. For example, this chart patterns happens during times of a "breakout" and a "fakeout" move. Therefore, a candlestick close back inside the chart pattern that had the breakout can signal a reversal trade.
