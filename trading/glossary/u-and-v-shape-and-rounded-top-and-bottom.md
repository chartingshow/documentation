# U-Shape, V-Shape and Rounded Top and Bottom Patterns

## U-Shape Patterns

- The pattern always starts with a breakout in either direction.
- The initial breakout is always accompanied by a volatility/volume increase.
- The second phase of the pattern, when the initial breakout is over, is a consolidation or a range phase, when the bulls and bears fight to control the price. This is characterized by a constant, yet similar volume level throughout the range period which is lower than the breakout first phase period.
- The volume in the range goes back to an equilibrium state, because the initial breakout is so big and unsustainable that the price and volume must pullgo back to the original state.
- The third phase is a breakout of the range (second phase) and a full reversal. Again there are large volume candles and price big movement.
- All the positions in phase one get liquidated.
- Price action continues further than the breakout before phase one period.
- This whole pattern usually acts as a "fakeout" move.

### U-Shape Tops Patterns

Also known as Bearish U-Shape / Inverted U-Shape pattern.

**Example 1:** Confirmed Bearish U-Shape pattern

### U-Shape Bottoms Patterns

Also known as Bullish U-Shape pattern.

## V-Shape Patterns

- The pattern always starts with a breakout in either direction.
- The initial breakout is always accompanied by a volatility/volume increase.
- The second phase is a very quick full reversal. Again there are large volume candles and price big movement.
- All the positions in phase one get liquidated.
- Price action continues further than the breakout before phase one period.
- This whole pattern usually acts as a "fakeout" move.

## Difference between U-Shape and V-Shape Patterns

The only difference between the two patterns is that U-Shape patterns contain three phases and V-Shape patterns contain two phases. U-Shape patterns have a consolidation (range) period in the middle; whereas V-Shape patterns do not have a consolidation (range) period and reveral very quickly!

U-Shape patterns are easier to trade as traders can set a breakout trade on the second phase on the consolidation (range) period.

V-Shape patterns are harder to trade, because V-tops and V-bottoms chart patterns are easy to spot after they have completed (but not while they are happening). Instead traders should trade the after effect when the V-Shape pattern has been confirmed. For example, this chart patterns happens during times of a "breakout" and a "fakeout" move. Therefore, a candlestick close back inside the chart pattern that had the breakout can signal a reversal trade.

### V-Shape Tops Patterns

Trading V-Tops is not an easy proposition. Draw a trendline along the bottoms as price rises in the first part of the V. When price pierces the trendline, then check for any fundamental news that would account for a reversal.

Action | Description
---|---
Uptrend | Look for price to make a straight-line run upward with few or no pauses, often fitting inside a channel (two parallel trendlines).
Reversal | Price at the top of the inverted V will form a quick reversal, usually on heavy volume.
Trendline | After the reversal, price pierces an up-sloping trendline drawn along the price lows, confirming the trend change.
Downtrend | Price trends down, usually at the mirror angle of the uptrend. If price climbed by 45 degrees, price will tumble following a 45 degree trend. The price trend tends to be a straight-line run with few or no pauses, often fitting inside a channel.

### V-Shape Bottoms Patterns

Trading a V-Bottoms are difficult because calling the turn at the bottom of the V is tough to do correctly. You can use a down trendline (drawn along the descending price tops leading to the V bottom) pierce as the buy signal but it's best to wait for price to confirm the tend change. You can also check the mirror angle. Often price will rise in an angle similar to the descent. If that appears to be the case, then buy.

Action | Description
---|---
Downtrend | Look for price to make a straight-line run downward with few or no pauses, often fitting inside a channel.
Reversal | Price at the bottom of the V will form a one-day reversal, island reversal, or tail, usually on heavy volume, perhaps gapping upward.
Trendline | After the reversal, price pierces a down-sloping trendline drawn along the price tops, confirming the trend change.
Uptrend | Price trends up, usually at the mirror angle of the downtrend. If price dropped by 30 degrees, price will rise following a similar angle. The price trend tends to be a straight-line run with few or no pauses, often fitting inside a channel.

## Recovery Patterns

Here are the most common economic recovery shapes and what they mean.

### V-Shaped Recovery

A V-shaped recovery means that the economy bounces back quickly to its baseline before the crisis, with no hiccups along the way. Growth continues at the same rate as before. This is one of the most optimistic recovery patterns because it implies that the downturn did not cause any lasting damage to the economy.

### U-Shaped Recovery

Under this scenario, the economic damage lasts for a longer period of time before eventually reaching the baseline level of growth again. The economy bounces back, but the damage at the bottom lingers for a while.

### W-Shaped Recovery

In a W-shaped recession, also called a double dip, the economy moves beyond a recession into a period of recovery before falling back down again into another recession. The initial recovery is sometimes known as a bear market rally.

### Swoosh-Shaped Recovery

A recovery scenario resembling the Nike "swoosh" logo is characterized by a steep drop and a gradual recovery, meaning that it takes much longer to return to pre-crisis growth levels than it took to fall into recession.

A variant of this is a square root-shaped recession where growth recovers but then plateaus before reaching pre-crisis levels.

### L-shaped Recovery

An L-shaped recovery is the most pessimistic scenario. In this shape, the economy recovers to a certain degree from a steep drop, but growth never reaches pre-crisis levels for years, if at all. A period of economic stagnation follows.
