# Bulls and Bears

The terms "Bulls" and "Bears" are used in financial markets to describe investor sentiment and market trends:

## Bulls

Bulls represent optimism and rising markets. A bull market is characterized by:

1. Sustained increase in asset prices, typically 20% or more from recent lows
2. Strong investor confidence and high demand for securities
3. Positive economic conditions, including high employment and GDP growth

Investors who believe prices will increase are called "bulls." The term may have originated from the upward thrusting motion of a bull's horns when attacking.

## Bears

Bears represent pessimism and declining markets. A bear market is characterized by:

1. Sustained decrease in asset prices, typically 20% or more from recent highs
2. Negative investor sentiment and increased selling pressure
3. Weakening economic conditions, such as falling GDP and rising unemployment

Investors who believe prices will decrease are called "bears." The term might have originated from bearskin traders who would sell skins before acquiring them, essentially short-selling.

These terms are widely used in various financial markets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and real estate, to describe overall market conditions and investor attitudes.
