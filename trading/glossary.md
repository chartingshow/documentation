## Trendlines

### How to Use Trend Lines in Trading

Trend lines are a fundamental tool in trading, aiding both beginners and seasoned traders due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They serve as a visual representation of market trajectory, indicating whether prices are moving upwards, downwards or sideways.

### Drawing Trend Lines Correctly

- **Uptrend Line:** Connect major bottoms to form an ascending trend line.
- **Downtrend Line:** Connect major tops to create a descending trend line.
- **Validity:** It takes at least two points to draw a trend line and three points to confirm it.
- **Avoid Forcing:** Do not manipulate trend lines to fit the market; if they don't align naturally, they are not valid.

### Types of Trends

1.  **Uptrend:** Characterized by higher lows.
2.  **Downtrend:** Marked by lower highs.
3.  **Sideways Trend:** Indicates a ranging market.

### Confirmed and Unconfirmed Trend Lines

- **Confirmed:** Drawn with a `solid` line.
- **Unconfirmed:** Drawn with a `dotted` or `dashed` line.

### Trading Strategies with Trend Lines

- **Trend Following:** Buy in uptrends and sell short in downtrends based on the direction of the trend line.
- **Trendline Breakouts:** Enter trades when prices break above or below trend lines, confirming potential reversals or continuations.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages:** Identify trends, entry/exit points, and price targets easily.
- **Disadvantages:** Subjective nature; different traders may draw different trend lines for the same chart.

In conclusion, mastering the art of drawing and interpreting trend lines can significantly enhance trading decisions by providing insights into market sentiment, potential shifts in trends and areas of support/resistance.
