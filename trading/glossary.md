### Trading Styles

Trading Styles can be tailored to an individual trader's time constraints, financial objectives, and personal attributes. Even while most traders have similar objectives, they employ a range of diverse trading strategies to get there.

There are five main styles of trading:

Name | Description
---|---
High-frequency trading | High-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of trading in which numerous orders are transacted in a matter of milliseconds thanks to the employment of robust computer programmes.
Scalping | Scalping trades are only held for a few seconds, or at most a few minutes.
Day trading | Trades in day trading are held for a few seconds to several hours.
Swing trading | Trades made in swing trading are often held for a few days or weeks.
Position trading | Trades in position trading are held for a few days to several years.
