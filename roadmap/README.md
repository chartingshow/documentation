# Roadmap

Below is our roadmap outlining the vision, direction, priorities and progress of all our products and features over time.

The Roadmap is a schedule of events and milestones that forecasts and communicates planned project solution deliverables over a time horizon and how they will be achieved.

                Users can adjust the settings to expand the forcast length and the machine learning modelling time.
                The results are displayed in the data window and there is a setting to hide it from the chart.</td>

            <td>During the weekend Bitcoin tends to go sideways. When Bitcoin goes sideways the retail traders get restless and Altcoins make some gains.
                It's worth noting when Bitcoin goes up the Altcoins will have a green day and when Bitcoin goes down the Altcoins tend to have a red day.
                Weekends also tend to not any "expected" fundamental news events.</td>

                This feature saves traders time be automatically calculating and drawing the area.
                Traders can turn this feature on/off. Algorithm uses fibonacci sequence and pivot points to generate the median area.</td>

It displays the result in the data window, cleaned to assets corresponding number of decimal places. Allows traders to add an average price trendline option via the settings.</td>
