## Binance to delist non-MiCA compliant stablecoins in Europe on March 31, 2025

Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced it will delist all non-MiCA compliant stablecoin trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA) on March 31, 2025, at 23:59 UTC. This move is in response to the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which impose stricter reserve requirements on stablecoin issuers.

The stablecoins affected by this delisting include:

1. Tether (USDT)
2. Dai (DAI)
3. First Digital USD (FDUSD)
4. TrueUSD (TUSD)
5. Pax Dollar (USDP)
6. Anchored Euro (AEUR)
7. TerraUSD (UST)
8. TerraClassicUSD (USTC)
9. PAX Gold (PAXG)

After the delisting, EEA users will no longer be able to trade these stablecoins in spot pairs on Binance. However, users will still be able to hold, deposit, and withdraw these non-compliant stablecoins. Binance will also allow users to sell their remaining non-compliant stablecoin holdings through Binance Convert after the March 31, 2025 deadline.

To ease the transition, Binance is encouraging EEA users to convert their non-compliant stablecoins to MiCA-compliant alternatives such as USD Coin (USDC), Eurite (EURI), or fiat currencies like the euro (EUR). The exchange has launched several promotional programs to facilitate this transition, including:

1. Zero trading fees for select USDC pairs for VIP users
2. Special trading fee promotions for spot trading and USDC margin trading
3. A trading competition with a prize pool of up to 1,000,000 USDC
4. High-profit earning opportunities with interest rates of up to 15% APR on USDC and EURI

It's important to note that MiCA-compliant stablecoins, including USDC and EURI, will continue to be available for trading on Binance. The exchange advises users to act early to avoid any disruption in their trading activities.

This move by Binance reflects the growing influence of MiCA regulations in the crypto industry and sets a precedent for other exchanges operating in the European region. The regulatory framework aims to bring transparency and stability to the cryptocurrency market in Europe, ensuring consumer protection and preventing risks associated with unregulated digital assets.

### Does this affect UK users?

**No, this delisting of non-MiCA compliant stablecoins does not affect UK users**. The announcement specifically targets users in the European Economic Area (EEA). The United Kingdom is no longer part of the EEA following Brexit, so UK/GB users of Binance will not be impacted by these changes related to MiCA compliance.

Binance's decision to delist certain stablecoin trading pairs is a response to the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which apply to the EEA countries but not to the UK. UK users should be able to continue trading these stablecoins on Binance without interruption, as the UK has its own regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies that is separate from the EU's MiCA regulations.
