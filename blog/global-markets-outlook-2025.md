# Global Markets Outlook 2025

Here is a technical summary of the Global Markets Outlook for 2025 by the Charting Show.

### Overview

The report outlines ten core investment themes expected to drive market views in 2025, emphasizing that markets have already priced in much of the anticipated "soft landing" scenario. It suggests a wider distribution of potential policy shifts and market outcomes, particularly concerning trade wars. The outlook favors US growth and a stronger dollar but advises hedging against tail risks.

### Key themes

1.  **Wider Distribution After the Soft Landing:** Solid US growth and low inflation remain the base case, but markets have largely priced this in, leading to a wider distribution of possible outcomes.
2.  **Weighing the Tariff Tail:** Tariffs on China are expected and manageable, but across-the-board tariffs would be more inflationary and risk-off.
3.  **Finding Terminal Rates in a World of Fiscal Risks:** Fiscal expansion in the US and other countries raises the risk of higher terminal rates.
4.  **Renewed Divergence Reinforces Dollar Strength:** US growth is expected to outpace other developed markets, supporting a stronger dollar, especially if a broader tariff agenda is pursued.
5.  **China in the Cross-hairs:** China faces challenges, but domestic policy responses could offset some negative impacts.
6.  **Europe and EM—A More Challenging Picture:** Europe faces growth headwinds from the Trump agenda, while emerging markets face challenges from higher rates and a stronger USD.
7.  **Energy Markets:** Oil prices are expected to be range-bound, with potential upside from geopolitics and downside from spare capacity.
8.  **Inflation Risk:** Expectation of slightly higher inflation risk, making value in Treasuries/TIPS.
9.  **Growing Valuation Challenge:** High US equity valuations pose a long-term challenge, with potential for a valuation penalty if the cycle turns.
10. **Diversification, Tails, and Hedges:** Recommends diversification and hedging strategies, including long USD positions alongside tails in oil and gold.

### Regional Insights

*   **US:** Expects solid growth, cooling inflation, and potential benefits from corporate-friendly policies. However, high equity valuations and the risk of a broader trade war are concerns.
*   **China:** Tariffs are anticipated, but domestic policy adjustments are expected to mitigate the impact.
*   **Europe:** Downgraded GDP forecasts due to trade uncertainty and competition from China. Expects the ECB to respond with deeper rate cuts.
*   **Emerging Markets:** Faces headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar, with a focus on markets that can withstand shocks.

### Recommendations

The report suggests maintaining exposure to US equities while diversifying and using options to limit tail risks. It also recommends considering long positions in Bunds and compression of rate spreads between core Europe and Central and Eastern Europe.

## Cryptocurrency Market Reaction 

Several key implications for the crypto market:  

### Market Vulnerabilities and Correction Risks

- Equities and crypto markets are "priced for perfection," making them susceptible to corrections due to rising bond yields, economic uncertainties, and profit-taking in overextended assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  
- Arthur Hayes predicts a **mid-2025 crypto correction** following a liquidity-driven Q1 rally, driven by Fed policy shifts and US Treasury spending.  

### Institutional Adoption and ETF Influence

- Wall Street has **$1.5B+ in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs**, signaling institutional confidence despite volatility concerns.  
- The bank's first-ever mention of digital assets in its annual report highlights crypto's growing mainstream acceptance, though it remains cautious about regulatory and cybersecurity risks.  

### Dollar Strength and Crypto as a Hedge

- A stronger USD (forecasted by Charting Show) could pressure crypto prices short-term but may increase Bitcoin's appeal as an **inflation hedge** in emerging markets.  
- The bank acknowledges Bitcoin's role in diversification, particularly in unstable monetary environments.  

### Strategic Takeaways for Crypto Traders

- **Short-term:** Expect volatility around Fed liquidity shifts and ETF inflows.  
- **Long-term:** Institutional adoption (via ETFs, blockchain investments) supports upward momentum, but corrections are likely given high valuations.  
- **Trade setup:** Monitor **liquidity indicators** (Fed Reverse Repo, Treasury spending) and institutional ETF flows for trend confirmation.  

The Charting Show's mixed stance—bullish via ETF holdings but wary of market froth—suggests a **tactical rather than all-in** approach to crypto in 2025.
