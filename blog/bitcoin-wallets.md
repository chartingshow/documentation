## Crypto Wallets Reviews and Comparisons

Crypto Wallets are worth it if the crypto exchange or investment platform doesn't offer in-built storage. Crypto wallets were created to protect your private key and crypto assets against security breaches.

Here are some of these top crypto wallets, including the best Crypto Wallets for mobile, desktop, and beginners.

Exodus and Trezor's partnership caters to those who prefer hardware security since you can securely manage your assets offline while simultaneously using the Exodus platform.

**Cons**: Exodus mainly caters to hot wallet (software) users. It may not be suitable for hardware-minded traders unless you plan to use a Trezor device with the app.

### BitBox02

**Best for**: Bitcoin-only storage

With BitBox's [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/) hardware wallet, you can store your crypto private keys and manage any assets offline through an external chip. It offers interactive touch features and an OLED screen for transaction details. BitBox supports multiple digital coins and tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

BitBox also provides a Bitcoin-only edition, which could be a great fit if you only want to store Bitcoin assets. It relies on Bitcoin-only firmware and offers compatibility with the BitBoxApp, Electrum, Specter, Sparrow, and Wasabi. The BitBoxApp also gives you desktop access.

**Cons**: If you like mobile access, you can only use BitBox on Android devices.

### Electrum

Electrum supports the Bitcoin Lightning Network and cold storage wallets with private keys. It has an open-source application structure and can be connected to hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger.

Electrum is a great option for desktop traders as it is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux. The desktop app offers an abundance of customizable features suitable for sophisticated crypto traders with programming experience.

**Cons**: Electrum doesn't offer traditional phone customer support. However, the company provides helpful information in its documentation and FAQ sections, plus a Reddit support page and an inquiry page on bitcointalk.org. Another thing to note is that while Electrum supports other wallets, but only for bitcoin transactions. This may be a downside for those interested in exploring other cryptocurrencies.

### Sparrow Wallet

[Sparrow](https://sparrowwallet.com/) is a Bitcoin wallet that's ideal for people who value financial independence. Sparrow's focus is on security, privacy, and usability. Sparrow doesn't hide information. Rather, it tries to provide as much detail about your transactions as possible and UTXOs as possible, but in a manageable and user-friendly manner. Sparrow supports all features that you would expect from a modern Bitcoin-wallet. Full support for single-sig and multisig wallets using common script types. There are many connection options available: Public servers, Bitcoin Core, and private Electrum servers. Standards-based, including full PSBT support. All common hardware wallets are supported in USB and air-gapped formats. Complete coin and fee control, with extensive coin selection. All transactions, inputs, and outputs are labeled. Multi-platform and lightweight. Built in Tor, Payjoin support with Testnet, Regtest, and Signet support. Sparrow is unique in that it includes a fully featured transaction editor.

- Moving on from Electrum. The Sparrow UI and UX is so much better and cleaner. I've setup my Coldcard with it and all transactions show up.
- Superb features + functionality, providing users with a very high degree of transparency and optionality.

**Cons**:

- Wish it scanned more derivation paths automatically.
- The option to have a built-in node would be a welcome addition.

Beginner and advanced bitcoin traders can use BlueWallet's simplified batch storing, sending, and receiving features. BlueWallet is a self-custodial wallet that provides private keys to individual investors in addition to multi-signature security measures. You can even set up a decoy pin.

**Cons**: This cold wallet storage is similar to Electrum in that it's bitcoin-focused. So, BlueWallet isn't a good option if you're looking to store other cryptocurrencies. Also, it should be noted that you can't buy or sell bitcoin assets with Blue Wallet.

### Crypto.com

**Best for**: DeFi products

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) is a global exchange headquartered in Hong Kong and one of the best cryptocurrency exchanges.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A Crypto Wallet is essentially a digital wallet for storing, sending, and receiving bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The assets in your crypto wallet are securely stored with a unique private key, similar to a password, to ensure that no one else can access the wallet.

Crypto Wallets are worth it if the crypto exchange or investment platform doesn't offer in-built storage. Crypto wallets were created to protect your private key and crypto assets against security breaches. While most wallets give you complete custody of your assets, not all exchanges and investment platforms do.

## Types of Crypto Wallets

There are two main types of crypto wallets for traders to store Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets securely.

- **Hot wallets**: A software wallet that provides easy access and accessible transactions by being connected to the internet. But this convenience has a price. Since hot wallets are connected to the internet, they are generally considered less secure due to online vulnerability.
- **Cold wallets**: A hardware wallet that stores private keys offline for enhanced security. Since cold wallets aren't connected to the internet, they are not susceptible to internet hackers or spyware. However, cold wallets are not as easily accessible. In many cases, there is only one key to access the wallet and no way to recover it if lost.

## How to Choose the Best Crypto Wallet

Some of the best investment apps also offer cryptocurrency trading and market access to the crypto market. Many of the best cryptocurrency exchanges offer an internal crypto wallet to store your digital assets, including bitcoin. But if your platform doesn't provide secure storage, or you prefer to keep your crypto separate, you can open an external wallet.

To secure your cryptocurrencies with a Crypto Wallet, you must create an account with your desired platform first. Most non-custodial wallets (wallets that you hold complete custody over) offer downloadable software that you can use to secure your private key and crypto assets.

However, if you're using a hardware wallet, you'll likely need a USB cable to connect to your platform's external storage chip. Once you've created your account, connected the necessary devices or downloaded any required software, you can transfer over any existing crypto assets.

## Best Practices for Crypto Wallet Security

- **Use strong passwords**: Create strong and unique passwords for your wallet and enable two-factor authentication for increased security.
- **Keep updated software**: Regularly update your wallet software to protect against potential security hacks, malware, and phishing attacks.
- **Backup your wallet**: Create secure backups of your wallet's seed phrase or private keys and store them offline safely.
- **Be wary of potential scams**: Be cautious of suspicious emails or links that could compromise your wallet security. Don't give out your private keys, make sure you have a unique password and notification alerts.
