### **1. Key Patterns & Observations**

* **Double Top** (around \$120K–122K):
  Strong bearish reversal pattern confirmed by rejection at resistance area 2.

* **Failed High (FH)** (around \$118K):
  Price attempted to push higher but failed to make a new high above the previous top, confirming weakness.

* **Support Zones:**

  * **Up Leg Move Support Area 1** (\$106K–108K region).
  * **Up Leg Move Support Area 2** (\$104K–106K region).
    Both align with the dynamic support area (green lines).

* **Current Price (at label 1):**
  Around \$113K, rolling over after rejecting resistance.

### **2. Sentiment & Trend**

* **Overall trend:** Uptrend (higher highs, higher lows), but weakening momentum.
* **Short-term sentiment:** Bearish bias after the failed high.
* **Indicators box (bottom right):** Shows *near-term bearish (60% odds)* vs *bullish (40%)* — aligning with chart structure.

### **3. Bullish & Bearish Scenarios**

#### **Bullish Case**

* Price holds \$112K–\$113K and quickly bounces.
* Buyers defend the **Up Leg Move Support Area 1** (\$106K–108K).
* A break back above \$118K (Failed High level) would target **Resistance Area 2** (\$122K–124K).

#### **Bearish Case**

* Price continues down into **Support Area 1** (\$106K–108K).
* If that fails, deeper correction into **Support Area 2** (\$104K–106K).
* A breakdown below \$104K could trigger a major shift in trend, ending the broader up leg.

### **4. Trading Suggestions**

* **Swing Traders:**

  * Watch for a retest of **\$112K–\$113K** → if rejected, short bias toward \$108K–\$106K.
  * Long opportunities only if \$106K–108K holds with strong bounce.
* **Scalpers:**

  * Trade inside the range \$112K resistance vs. \$108K support.
* **Risk Management:**

  * Set tight stops below \$104K if long.
  * Short entries safer near resistance (\$118K rejection) rather than chasing at support.

### **5. Conclusion**

Price action is still in a **macro uptrend**, but short-term bias is **bearish** after the failed high.

➡️ Likely path: Retrace into **\$108K–106K support zone** before making next move.

➡️ Bulls must reclaim **\$118K** to regain control.
