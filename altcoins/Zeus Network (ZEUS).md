### Ecosystem Integration

Zeus Network is designed to attract developers from the Solana ecosystem, which is known for its speed and low transaction costs. This integration potential could lead to a more robust and diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi services.

By combining these features, Zeus Network offers a more secure, efficient, and versatile cross-chain solution compared to many existing alternatives, particularly for interactions between Bitcoin and Solana ecosystems.

## How does Zeus Network ensure the security of cross-chain transactions?

Zeus Network employs several robust security measures to ensure the safety of cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and Solana:

### Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

Zeus Network uses a sophisticated MPC approach for managing private keys. When users deposit Bitcoin, it's sent to a Taproot address, and six Zeus nodes divide and mix up the private key using MPC. This ensures that no single entity has complete control over the deposited funds, significantly reducing the risk of theft or loss.

### Distributed Custody Model

The network utilizes a distributed custody model where Bitcoin is held in Taproot addresses controlled by multiple Zeus nodes. This decentralized approach eliminates single points of failure and enhances overall security.

### Guardian System

Zeus Network employs a network of Guardians who validate and sign transactions across both chains. These Guardians stake $ZEUS tokens, aligning their interests with the network's security. They participate in transaction validation and network governance, adding an extra layer of security to the cross-chain process.

### Fraud Proofs and Slashing

The system implements fraud proofs and a slashing program to detect and penalize unauthorized transactions. This economic security model encourages nodes to provide evidence of fraud, with rewards given for identifying malicious activities.

### Challenge Period

Zeus Network incorporates a "challenge period" after each operation, allowing for the identification and addressing of any discrepancies or fraudulent activities. This multi-layered approach ensures safe and efficient value transfer between Bitcoin and Solana.

### Threshold Signature System

Transactions are validated using a threshold signature system, which maintains security while ensuring efficient processing of cross-chain operations.

### Proof-of-Stake Mechanism

To maintain consensus and security, Zeus Network employs a proof-of-stake mechanism. Verifiers stake SOL tokens or liquid staking derivatives of SOL (LD-SOL) to participate in transaction validation.

By combining these advanced security features, Zeus Network creates a robust and trustless environment for cross-chain transactions between Bitcoin and Solana, significantly mitigating the risks associated with traditional bridge solutions.

The round was led by **Mechanism Capital** and included participation from other prominent venture capital firms such as **OKX Ventures**, **Animoca Ventures**, **Big Brain Holdings**, **Lemniscap**, and **The Spartan Group**. Additionally, notable angel investors like **Anatoly Yakovenko** (Solana co-founder), **Muneeb Ali** (Stacks co-creator), and **Andrew Kang** (Mechanism Capital founder) also contributed to the funding.

This funding round valued Zeus Network at $100 million and was aimed at enhancing its cross-chain interoperability capabilities, particularly between Bitcoin and Solana. The financial backing underscores strong investor confidence in Zeus Network's mission to revolutionize blockchain interoperability and decentralized finance (DeFi).

## How many tokens does the team hold and is their any vesting periods?

According to the token distribution details for Zeus Network:

The team holds 15% of the total supply, which amounts to 150 million ZEUS tokens.

Regarding the vesting period for the team allocation:

1. There is a 15-month cliff period.
2. After the cliff, there is a 15-month linear vesting schedule.
3. At the Token Generation Event (TGE), the team receives 0% of their allocation.

This vesting structure is designed to align the team's interests with the long-term success of the project and prevent immediate sell-offs. As of the current date (March 7, 2025), the team's tokens are still in the vesting process, with no tokens having been released at the TGE and gradual unlocking occurring over time.

## Are there any restrictions on when the team can sell their tokens?

Yes, there are restrictions on when the team can sell their Zeus Network tokens. The team's allocation, which is 15% of the total supply (150 million ZEUS tokens), is subject to a vesting schedule designed to align their interests with the long-term success of the project.

The vesting schedule for the team's tokens includes:

1. A 15-month cliff period
2. Followed by a 15-month linear vesting schedule
3. No tokens released at the Token Generation Event (TGE)

This vesting structure means that the team cannot immediately sell their tokens upon launch. The cliff period ensures that no tokens are accessible for the first 15 months after the TGE. After this initial period, the tokens gradually become available over the next 15 months.

As of the current date (March 7, 2025), the team's tokens are still in the vesting process. Given that the TGE likely occurred sometime in 2024, the cliff period has likely ended, and the linear vesting is now in progress. This gradual release of tokens helps prevent large sell-offs that could negatively impact the token's value and demonstrates the team's commitment to the project's long-term viability.
