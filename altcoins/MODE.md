5. Native Yield: Mode plans to introduce native yield for assets on its network, which could attract users looking for DeFi opportunities.

Compared to other prominent Layer 2 solutions:

- Arbitrum and Optimism: Like Mode, these solutions use optimistic rollups. However, Mode's sequencer fee sharing model and developer-focused incentives are unique features that set it apart.

- Polygon: While Polygon offers a multi-chain design with support for various scaling techniques, Mode focuses on optimizing the Ethereum experience through its integration with the Optimism ecosystem.

- StarkNet: Unlike StarkNet, which uses zk-rollups, Mode utilizes optimistic rollups. This means Mode may have different trade-offs in terms of security and transaction finality.

Mode's approach of directly rewarding developers and users for their contributions to the ecosystem, combined with its cost-effectiveness and integration with the Optimism stack, positions it as a competitive player in the Layer 2 space. However, as a newer entrant, it will need to prove its reliability and attract a significant user base to compete with more established solutions.

## What makes Mode's partnership with Optimism significant?

Mode's partnership with Optimism is significant because it leverages the Optimism Bedrock upgrade and OP Stack to enhance scalability, reduce costs, and foster interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are the key aspects of this partnership:

1. **Integration with the Optimism Superchain**: Mode is built on the OP Stack, which is part of Optimism's vision for a "Superchain"—a scalable and interoperable network of Layer 2 solutions. This integration ensures Mode benefits from shared security, faster transaction speeds, and lower gas fees provided by Optimism's Bedrock infrastructure.

2. **Developer and User Incentives**: Mode incorporates unique features like Sequencer Fee Sharing and User Referral Fees, which align with Optimism's community-driven philosophy. These mechanisms encourage developers and users to actively participate in Mode's ecosystem while benefiting from the scalability and cost-efficiency of Optimism.

3. **Alignment with Ethereum's Vision**: Optimism's design philosophy prioritizes Ethereum's long-term success by maintaining close compatibility with its ecosystem. By building on Optimism, Mode ensures sustainability and access to a growing pool of Ethereum-compatible developers and applications.

This partnership positions Mode as a key player in the broader Ethereum scaling landscape while contributing to the growth of the Optimism Superchain.

## How does Mode's partnership with Optimism enhance scalability?

Mode's partnership with Optimism enhances scalability in several key ways:

1. **Optimism Bedrock Integration**: Mode is built on the OP Stack and leverages Optimism's Bedrock upgrade, which significantly reduces transaction costs—by over 95% compared to Ethereum—and improves throughput. This makes Mode highly efficient for developers and users.

2. **Span Batches for Cost Efficiency**: The Delta network upgrade, which introduced Span Batches, allows Mode to encode multiple blocks into single batches, reducing the amount of Layer 1 (L1) data posted. This innovation lowers operational costs by up to 99%, enabling Mode to scale sustainably while maintaining low fees for users.

3. **EVM Compatibility**: Mode's full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ensures seamless migration of applications and smart contracts from Ethereum or other EVM-compatible chains, simplifying development and fostering scalability.

4. **Modular Architecture**: Mode's modular design within the Optimism Superchain allows for flexibility and future scalability enhancements. It supports the creation of custom application chains (Layer 3s) like Mode Flare, which further extend scalability while offering lower fees and higher throughput.

5. **Shared Security and Interoperability**: By being part of the Optimism Superchain, Mode benefits from shared security and interoperability with other chains in the ecosystem, reducing redundancy and enabling seamless cross-chain interactions.

These features collectively position Mode as a scalable and cost-effective solution for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, driving adoption and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## How does Mode's cost-effectiveness compare to other Layer 2 solutions?

Mode's cost-effectiveness is competitive among Layer 2 solutions, but it's not necessarily the most cost-effective option available. Here's how Mode compares to other Layer 2 solutions in terms of cost-effectiveness:

1. Significant fee reduction: Mode has reduced fees by over 95% compared to Ethereum by implementing the Optimism Bedrock upgrade. This puts it in line with other optimistic rollup solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism, which also offer substantial fee reductions.

2. Optimistic rollup advantage: As an optimistic rollup solution, Mode generally has lower transaction costs compared to ZK-rollups like zkSync Era, Linea, and Starknet. This is because ZK-rollups typically have higher computational costs due to their complex cryptographic processes.

3. Fee-sharing mechanism: Mode's unique sequencer fee-sharing model allows developers to receive a portion of the network's sequencer revenue based on the transaction fees their contracts generate. This can potentially lead to even lower costs for users of popular applications on the network.

4. Competitive positioning: While Mode offers significant cost reductions, it's important to note that other Layer 2 solutions also provide very low transaction costs. For example, some Layer 2 solutions offer transaction costs as low as $0.002.

5. Proto-Danksharding impact: The recent Ethereum Proto-Danksharding upgrade (EIP-4844) has drastically reduced transaction costs across all Layer 2 solutions. This means that while Mode remains cost-effective, the gap between different Layer 2 solutions has narrowed.

6. Optimization potential: As a newer entrant in the Layer 2 space, Mode may have room for further optimization and cost reduction as the network matures and adopts new technologies.

While Mode offers competitive cost-effectiveness, it's important to note that transaction costs can fluctuate based on network activity and ongoing technological improvements. Users should compare current fees across different Layer 2 solutions to determine the most cost-effective option for their specific needs.

## When can the project team sell their tokens?

The project team's ability to sell their MODE tokens is subject to a vesting schedule with specific restrictions:

Initial lock-up period: The tokens are subject to an initial lock of approximately twelve months from the Token Generation Event (TGE)8.

Vesting period: After the initial lock-up, the tokens are set to be distributed in equal tranches over a 24-month linear vesting period8.

Distribution schedule: The company expects its MODE tokens to be distributed in equal tranches on a monthly basis over the 24-month vesting period8.

Given that the Mode Network launched its mainnet in January 2024 and began its token distribution in May 2024, the project team's tokens are likely still under the initial lock-up period as of the current date (March 7, 2025). The vesting schedule would begin after this lock-up period ends, which would be around May 2025.

Therefore, the project team would be able to start selling a portion of their tokens gradually starting from around May 2025, with full distribution completed by approximately May 2027. This extended vesting schedule helps ensure long-term commitment from the team and aligns their interests with the project's success3.
