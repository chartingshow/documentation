# Orbiter Finance (OBT)

Orbiter Finance is a decentralized cross-chain infrastructure project that facilitates fast, secure, and low-cost transfers of Ethereum native assets between different Layer 2 (L2) networks and rollups. It was launched around the end of 2022 and quickly gained popularity due to its excellent user experience and efficient cross-chain capabilities.

Key features of Orbiter Finance include:

1. Cross-chain bridge: Orbiter focuses on bridging assets within the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly between various L2 solutions.

2. Speed and cost-efficiency: Transactions can be completed within 10 to 20 seconds, making it one of the fastest cross-chain solutions available.

3. Security: Orbiter's design minimizes risks associated with traditional cross-chain bridges by leveraging the security of rollups.

4. Wide network support: It supports multiple networks, including Ethereum, zkSync, Polygon, Arbitrum, StarkNet, and others.

5. Decentralization: Orbiter aims for a fully decentralized model, allowing for the addition of various ERC20 token liquidity.

Orbiter Finance uses a unique model involving "Senders" and "Makers" to facilitate cross-chain transactions. The project has attracted significant investment, with a reported valuation of $200 million after its Series A funding round in early 2024.

While Orbiter Finance has announced plans to issue tokens within the year, as of March 2025, it's important to note that the token (OBT) may not yet be widely available or traded.

## How does Orbiter Finance's revenue model work?

Orbiter Finance's revenue model is primarily based on the number of transactions rather than the total transaction volume. This unique approach has allowed the platform to generate significant and stable income over the past two years.

The revenue model consists of two main components:

1. Transaction fees: These are charged as a percentage of the transfer amount, typically between 0.02% and 0.2%.

2. Withholding fees: Initially presented as a cost to cover gas fees for transfers, these fees are actually a major source of income for Orbiter.

The key to Orbiter's high revenue lies in the withholding fees. For example, when transferring from L1 to the Base chain, Makers charge about 0.0015 ETH per transaction (roughly $3-$5) to offset gas costs. Users are generally not overly sensitive to these fees, especially when performing complex on-chain operations.

Orbiter's revenue is boosted by users frequently performing cross-chain operations to accumulate airdrop points. This behavior converts user activity into a consistent income stream for the platform.

As of January 2025, Orbiter Finance has processed over 35.37 million transactions with a total volume exceeding $28 billion. This high transaction count, combined with their fee structure, contributes to their reported monthly income of several million dollars.

The platform's Gas Fee Prepaid model not only meets the demand for fast transactions in the crypto market but also ensures a stable monthly income. With the continued expansion of the Layer 2 ecosystem, Orbiter Finance's revenue is expected to grow further.

## How does Orbiter Finance's transaction fee structure compare to other cross-chain bridges?

Orbiter Finance's transaction fee structure is generally competitive compared to other cross-chain bridges, particularly for Layer 2 (L2) transfers. Here's how it compares:

### **Fee Efficiency**

- **Lower Gas Consumption:** Orbiter Finance uses ZK-rollups and a streamlined transfer mechanism that minimizes gas usage. For example, ETH bridging on Orbiter consumes approximately 21,000 gas, compared to 120,000â€“450,000 gas on competing bridges like Stargate or others.
- **Withholding Fees:** While Orbiter charges withholding fees to cover gas costs, these fees sometimes exceed the actual gas expenses, contributing significantly to its revenue. For instance, users may pay up to 0.0015 ETH per transaction even when the actual cost is lower.

### **Cost Comparisons**

- **L2 Transfers:** Orbiter is particularly cost-effective for L2-to-L2 transfers due to its optimized infrastructure. Competing solutions often charge higher fees for similar transactions.
- **L1 Transfers:** For transfers involving Layer 1 (L1) networks, Orbiter's fees may not always be the lowest. In some cases, withholding fees and transaction fees combined can make its cost higher than competitors like Stargate.
- **Small Transactions:** Orbiter is well-suited for small cross-chain transactions because of its low base costs. However, for larger transactions, the percentage-based fee structure can become less competitive.

### **Competitor Comparison**

- Traditional bridges like Stargate rely heavily on transaction fee revenue but often charge higher gas fees due to more complex smart contract interactions.
- Some bridges offer "zero-fee" promotions or subsidize costs for specific chains (e.g., Arbitrum Nova), but these are often temporary and may not provide consistent savings.

In summary, Orbiter Finance excels in speed and cost efficiency for L2 transfers but may not always offer the lowest fees across all routes or conditions. Its withholding fee model can sometimes make it more expensive than competitors for specific use cases.

## What are the future plans for Orbiter Finance?

Orbiter Finance has several ambitious plans for the future:

## How many tokens does the team hold and is their any vesting periods?

The team and contributors of Orbiter Finance hold 15% of the total OBT token supply, which amounts to 1.5 billion OBT tokens.

Regarding the vesting period for the team's tokens:

1. There is an initial cliff period before any tokens are unlocked.
2. After the cliff, the team's tokens will vest linearly over 35 months.
3. At the Token Generation Event (TGE) on January 20, 2025, the team's allocation will have 0% unlocked.

This vesting schedule is designed to incentivize long-term commitment from the team and core contributors, ensuring their continued focus on the project's development and technological innovation.

## How does the vesting period for the Orbiter team's tokens affect their trading strategy?

The vesting period for the Orbiter Finance team's tokens significantly impacts their trading strategy and aligns their interests with the project's long-term success:

1. Gradual Token Release: The team's tokens are subject to a 35-month linear vesting period after an initial cliff. This means they cannot immediately sell all their tokens, preventing a sudden influx of supply into the market.

2. Reduced Selling Pressure: By releasing tokens gradually over time, the vesting schedule helps minimize potential price volatility and selling pressure on OBT tokens.

3. Long-term Commitment: The extended vesting period encourages the team to remain committed to the project's development and success over a longer timeframe.

4. Market Stability: The controlled release of team tokens supports a more stable OBT token price, which can help build investor confidence in the project.

5. Mitigating "Pump and Dump" Risks: The vesting schedule makes it difficult for team members to engage in short-term speculation or "pump and dump" schemes, promoting responsible trading behavior.

6. Alignment of Interests: By tying token release to continued involvement, the vesting schedule aligns the team's interests with the project's long-term goals and overall token holder value.

This vesting structure for the Orbiter Finance team's tokens effectively encourages a focus on sustainable growth and project development rather than short-term price movements or quick profits.

## Are there any restrictions on when the team can sell their tokens?

Yes, there are strict restrictions on when the Orbiter Finance team can sell their tokens due to the vesting schedule:

1. **Initial Cliff Period**: The team and contributors' tokens have a 6-month cliff from the Token Generation Event (TGE) on January 20, 2025. During this period, no tokens can be sold or accessed.

2. **Linear Vesting**: After the cliff, the team's 1.5 billion OBT allocation will vest linearly over 36 months. This gradual release ensures that only a small portion of tokens becomes available each month.

3. **No Immediate Unlock at TGE**: At the time of the TGE, 0% of the team's tokens are unlocked, meaning they cannot trade or sell any tokens immediately.

These restrictions are designed to align the team's incentives with the long-term success of Orbiter Finance and prevent sudden selling pressure that could destabilize the token's price.
