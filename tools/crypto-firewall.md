<h3>Recommended versions</h3>

The firewall is known to reduce performance slightly and this is why we have several **different** versions.

Here's a suggested guide based on cpu processors:

- **Intel i3** - use `full` version (if you experience bad performance then try `lite` version instead).
- **Intel i5** - use `full` version (if you experience bad performance then try `lite` version instead).
- **Intel i7** - use `mega` version (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).
- **Intel i9** - use `beta` or `mega` (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).

Here's a suggested guide based on device:

- **Mobile** or **Tablet** - use `full` version (if you experience bad performance then try `lite` version instead).
- **Laptop** or **Computer** - use `beta` or `mega` version (if you experience bad performance then try `full` version instead).
