# Historical data from Binance to Machine Learning AI Models

This is an example of how to get historical data of a currency pair from Binance API and apply a basic indicator to it and then preprocess the data to be used in deep learning projects (to use the binance API you must have an account).

## libraries required - Python 3.6 or later

- numpy.
- pandas.
- sklearn.
- ta.
- binance.

Clone and Use the Repository:

To use this repository and obtain historical data from Binance for deep learning projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the git clone command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code

```python
git clone https://github.com/chartingshow/documentation.git
```

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.7 or later** installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code

```python
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn ta binance
```

This will install the necessary libraries, including: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `ta` and `binance`.

3. Configure Binance API Credentials

To use the Binance API, you need to configure your credentials. Open the `config.py`` file in the repository and replace "**Your_API_Key_Here**" and "**Your_API_Secret_Here**" with your Binance API key and API secret, respectively:

**NOTE:** If you prefer not to use an API key, you can use the `get_binance_bars(symbol, interval, startTime, endTime)` function.

```
python
Copy code
API_KEY = "Your_API_Key_Here"
API_SECRET = "Your_API_Secret_Here"
```
